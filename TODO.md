# TODO: Ensure Transactions from Database are Reflected in UI

- [x] Update `src/app/(root)/transaction-history/page.tsx` to fetch and display the full list of user transactions from the database.
- [x] Optionally, enhance `components/RightSidebar.tsx` to display a summary or list of recent transactions in the sidebar.
- [x] Test the changes by running the app locally and verifying transactions appear in the UI after signup/signin.
